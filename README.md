I developed a Wordle cum Hangman style game as a web app. The challenge is to guess Sanskrit names of the yoga poses (asanas) with Wordle style clues. One can test their knowledge of Asana names. The player can only play one puzzle a day. One can learn more about yoga and the different aasanas. 

This is supported on both desktop and handheld devices.
